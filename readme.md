:floppy_disk: Cyprus Municipality boundaries kml data by [@OpenDataCy](https://www.data.gov.cy) rendered in Google Maps.  
:globe_with_meridians: Language support for English and Greek (detected by lang attribute in <html> tag).  
  
:warning: In case this is tested or being developed in a local environment, google maps must load the kml data from online resources, thus, kml data in this repo will be used instead. When published, a base url for kml data must be defined as a data attribute in div#map tag pointing the server directory where the kml data are stored.
